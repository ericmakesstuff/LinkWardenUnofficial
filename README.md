# LinkWarden Unofficial

A project to create an unofficial Android app for LinkWarden.

## About

I am an independent developer. Please do not ask for support for LinkWarden.

This app is functional but unfinished. There are still to-do items, such as pagination, multiple tags, and images. I developed this to address my use-case, which is sharing URLs on Android to create LinkWarden links, viewing recent links, and searching. I will try to keep adding features.

I have no idea what maintenance will look like, how often updates will be needed to keep this working. I am not in charge of the LinkWarden API, so if they change it, the app may stop working until I have time to fix it.

## Getting Started

This project is made with Flutter. Once Flutter is installed, you should be able to run it in the standard ways.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
